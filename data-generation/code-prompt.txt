You are asked to come up with a set of 20 diverse software engineering-related task instructions. 
These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

1. Try not to repeat software engineering-related verbs for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. Use technical language and terminology related to software engineering in the instructions.
3. Include diverse types of software engineering tasks such as coding, debugging, testing, documentation, etc.
4. Ensure that the instructions are feasible for a language model to complete related to software engineering. For example, you could ask the model to generate code or suggest a solution to a programming problem.
5. The instructions should be in English but may include technical jargon and terms commonly used in software engineering.
6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the software engineering instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.
8. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, "what is object-oriented programming," it is not necessary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put "<noinput>" in the input field.
9. The output should be an appropriate response to the software engineering instruction and the input. Make sure the output is less than 100 words and related to software engineering.
