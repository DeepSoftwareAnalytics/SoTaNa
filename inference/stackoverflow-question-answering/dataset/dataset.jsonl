The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view.

{"question_id": 561166, "question_type": 3, "question_title": "Binding a WPF ComboBox to a custom list", "question_body": "I have a ComboBox that doesn't seem to update the SelectedItem/SelectedValue. The ComboBox ItemsSource is bound to a property on a ViewModel class that lists a bunch of RAS phonebook entries as a CollectionView. Then I've bound (at separate times) both the <code>SelectedItem</code> or <code>SelectedValue</code> to another property of the ViewModel. I have added a MessageBox into the save command to debug the values set by the databinding, but the <code>SelectedItem</code>/<code>SelectedValue</code> binding is not being set. The ViewModel class looks something like this: The _phonebookEntries collection is being initialised in the constructor from a business object. The ComboBox XAML looks something like this: I am only interested in the actual string value displayed in the ComboBox, not any other properties of the object as this is the value I need to pass across to RAS when I want to make the VPN connection, hence <code>DisplayMemberPath</code> and <code>SelectedValuePath</code> are both the Name property of the ConnectionViewModel. The ComboBox is in a <code>DataTemplate</code> applied to an <code>ItemsControl</code> on a Window who's DataContext  has been set to a ViewModel instance. The ComboBox displays the list of items correctly, and I can select one in the UI with no problem. However when I display the message box from the command, the PhonebookEntry property still has the initial value in it, not the selected value from the ComboBox. Other TextBox instances are updating fine and displaying in the MessageBox. What am I missing with databinding the ComboBox? I've done a lot of searching and can't seem to find anything that I'm doing wrong. This is the behaviour I'm seeing, however it's not working for some reason in my particular context. I have a MainWindowViewModel which has a <code>CollectionView</code> of ConnectionViewModels. In the MainWindowView.xaml file code-behind, I set the DataContext to the MainWindowViewModel. The MainWindowView.xaml has an <code>ItemsControl</code> bound to the collection of ConnectionViewModels. I have a DataTemplate that holds the ComboBox as well as some other TextBoxes. The TextBoxes are bound directly to properties of the ConnectionViewModel using <code>Text=\"{Binding Path=ConnectionName}\"</code>. The XAML code-behind: Then XAML: The TextBoxes all bind correctly, and data moves between them and the ViewModel with no trouble. It's only the ComboBox that isn't working. You are correct in your assumption regarding the PhonebookEntry class. The assumption I am making is that the DataContext used by my DataTemplate is automatically set through the binding hierarchy, so that I don't have to explicitly set it for each item in the <code>ItemsControl</code>. That would seem a bit silly to me. Here is a test implementation that demonstrates the problem, based on the example above. XAML: The code-behind: If you run that example, you will get the behaviour I'm talking about. The TextBox updates its binding fine when you edit it, but the ComboBox does not. Very confusing seeing as really the only thing I've done is introduce a parent ViewModel. I am currently labouring under the impression that an item bound to the child of a DataContext has that child as its DataContext. I can't find any documentation that clears this up one way or the other. I.e., Window -> DataContext = MainWindowViewModel ..Items -> Bound to DataContext.PhonebookEntries ....Item -> DataContext = PhonebookEntry (implicitly associated) I don't know if that explains my assumption any better(? ).

Also, how do I find files which are not under version control?", "tags": ["svn", "command"], "answer_posts": [86052, 86067, 86073, 86088, 86208], "answer_body": "(This answer has been updated to match SVN 1.8 and 1.9's behaviour) You have 2 questions: Marking files as ignored: By \"ignored file\" I mean the file won't appear in lists even as \"unversioned\": your SVN client will pretend the file doesn't exist at all in the filesystem. Ignored files are specified by a \"file pattern\". The syntax and format of file patterns is explained in SVN's online documentation: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html \"File Patterns in Subversion\". Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns. Here's a summary with examples: 1 - Runtime Configuration Area - <code>global-ignores</code> option: This is a client-side only setting, so your <code>global-ignores</code> list won't be shared by other users, and it applies to all repos you checkout onto your computer. This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: Windows (file-based) - <code>C:\\Users\\{you}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Subversion\\config</code> Windows (registry-based) - <code>Software\\Tigris.org\\Subversion\\Config\\Miscellany\\global-ignores</code> in both <code>HKLM</code> and <code>HKCU</code>. Linux/Unix - <code>~/.subversion/config</code> 2 - The <code>svn:ignore</code> property, which is set on directories (not files): This is stored within the repo, so other users will have the same ignore files. Similar to how <code>.gitignore</code> works. <code>svn:ignore</code> is applied to directories and is non-recursive or inherited. Any file or immediate subdirectory of the parent directory that matches the File Pattern will be excluded. While SVN 1.8 adds the concept of \"inherited properties\", the <code>svn:ignore</code> property itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories: (So the file <code>./subdirectory/ignoreThis</code> is not ignored, even though \"<code>ignoreThis.txt</code>\" is applied on the <code>.</code> repo root). Therefore, to apply an ignore list recursively you must use <code>svn propset svn:ignore &lt;filePattern&gt; . --recursive</code>. This will create a copy of the property on every subdirectory. If the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> value is different in a child directory then the child's value completely overrides the parents, so there is no \"additive\" effect. So if you change the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> on the root <code>.</code>, then you must change it with <code>--recursive</code> to overwrite it on the child and descendant directories. I note that the command-line syntax is counter-intuitive. I started-off assuming that you would ignore a file in SVN by typing something like <code>svn ignore pathToFileToIgnore.txt</code> however this is not how SVN's ignore feature works. 3- The <code>svn:global-ignores</code> property. Requires SVN 1.8 (June 2013): This is similar to <code>svn:ignore</code>, except it makes use of SVN 1.8's \"inherited properties\" feature. Compare to <code>svn:ignore</code>, the file pattern is automatically applied in every descendant directory (not just immediate children). This means that is unnecessary to set <code>svn:global-ignores</code> with the <code>--recursive</code> flag, as inherited ignore file patterns are automatically applied as they're inherited. Running the same set of commands as in the previous example, but using <code>svn:global-ignores</code> instead: For TortoiseSVN users: This whole arrangement was confusing for me, because TortoiseSVN's terminology (as used in their Windows Explorer menu system) was initially misleading to me - I was unsure what the significance of the Ignore menu's \"Add  recursively\", \"Add *\" and \"Add \" options. I hope this post explains how the Ignore feature ties-in to the SVN Properties feature. That said, I suggest using the command-line to set ignored files so you get a feel for how it works instead of using the GUI, and only using the GUI to manipulate properties after you're comfortable with the command-line. Listing files that are ignored: The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern. Use the <code>--no-ignore</code> option to see those files listed. Ignored files have a status of <code>I</code>, then pipe the output to <code>grep</code> to only show lines starting with \"I\".

Here is the code, <code>public class CharSetTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(\"Default Charset=\" + Charset.defaultCharset());        System.setProperty(\"file.encoding\", \"Latin-1\");        System.out.println(\"file.encoding=\" + System.getProperty(\"file.encoding\"));        System.out.println(\"Default Charset=\" + Charset.defaultCharset());        System.out.println(\"Default Charset in Use=\" + getDefaultCharSet());    }    private static String getDefaultCharSet() {        OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new ByteArrayOutputStream());        String enc = writer.getEncoding();        return enc;    }}</code> Our server requires default charset in Latin-1 to deal with some mixed encoding (ANSI/Latin-1/UTF-8) in a legacy protocol. So all our servers run with this JVM parameter, <code>-Dfile.encoding=ISO-8859-1</code> Here is the result on Java 5, <code>Default Charset=ISO-8859-1file.encoding=Latin-1Default Charset=UTF-8Default Charset in Use=ISO8859_1</code> Someone tries to change the encoding runtime by setting the file.encoding in the code. We all know that doesn't work. However, this apparently throws off defaultCharset() but it doesn't affect the real default charset used by OutputStreamWriter. Is this a bug or feature? EDIT: The accepted answer shows the root cause of the issue. Basically, you can't trust defaultCharset() in Java 5, which is not the default encoding used by I/O classes.

I did reproduce your bug with JVM 1.5. Looking at the source code of 1.5, the cached default charset isn't being set.

This name isn't found, because it's incorrect, and returns the default <code>UTF-8</code>. As for why the IO classes such as <code>OutputStreamWriter</code> return an unexpected result, the implementation of <code>sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder</code> (witch is used by these IO classes) is different as well for JVM 1.5 and JVM 1.6. The JVM 1.6 implementation is based in the <code>Charset.defaultCharset()</code> method to get the default encoding, if one is not provided to IO classes. The JVM 1.5 implementation uses a different method <code>Converters.getDefaultEncodingName();</code> to get the default charset.

This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output. When you modify the volume (a slider, let's say) that would correspond to modifying the value associated with a node in a directed graph. Various nodes having edges from that \"volume value\" node would automatically be triggered and any necessary computations and updates would naturally ripple through the application. The application \"reacts\" to the user stimulus. Functional reactive programming would just be the implementation of this idea in a functional language, or generally within a functional programming paradigm. For more on \"dataflow computing\", search for those two words on Wikipedia or using your favorite search engine. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs \"triggered\" or \"marked\". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. The graph might be implicit or explicit depending on exactly how reactive programming is implemented. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks). Reactive programming imports this \"cascade of execution\" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the \"outside world\" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. Program execution would then look like something analogous to a complex reflex arc. The program may or may not be basically sessile between stimuli or may settle into a basically sessile state between stimuli. \"non-reactive\" programming would be programming with a very different view of the flow of execution and relationship to external inputs. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs \"reacts\" to them. But looking at the spirit of the thing, a program that polls an event queue at a fixed interval and dispatches any events found to functions (or threads) is less reactive (because it only attends to user input at a fixed interval). Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.", "truth": "[0, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 19, 21]", "answer_id": 1028551}

The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. That means if you left shift 1101100 and then right shift it, you won't get the same result back. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division, provided you are working with a power of 2. Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example, way back in the olden days, we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h, the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel, you would use the following math: Now, back in that day and age, speed was critical, so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However, 320 is not a power of two, so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: Now we get the same offset as before, except instead of an expensive multiplication operation, we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note, it's been forever since I've done assembly (editor's note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)): Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes, we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode, both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput), so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower, especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs, and AMD Ryzen, two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc, clang, and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing <code>return 320*row + col;</code>. The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction (<code>LEA</code>) that can do small left shifts and add at the same time, with the performance as and <code>add</code> instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. So scaling by a compile-time-constant that's known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply. OK, back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer.

The issue is that I get an out of memory error when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity. <li>Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (<em>bit wise</em>)?

The 'best' algorithm really depends on which CPU you are on and what your usage pattern is. Some CPUs have a single built-in instruction to do it and others have parallel instructions which act on bit vectors. The parallel instructions (like x86's <code>popcnt</code>, on CPUs where it's supported) will almost certainly be fastest. Some other architectures may have a slow instruction implemented with a microcoded loop that tests a bit per cycle (citation needed). A pre-populated table lookup method can be very fast if your CPU has a large cache and/or you are doing lots of these instructions in a tight loop. However it can suffer because of the expense of a 'cache miss', where the CPU has to fetch some of the table from main memory. If you know that your bytes will be mostly 0's or mostly 1's then there are very efficient algorithms for these scenarios. I believe a very good general purpose algorithm is the following, known as 'parallel' or 'variable-precision SWAR algorithm'. I have expressed this in a C-like pseudo language, you may need to adjust it to work for a particular language (e.g. using uint32_t for C++ and >>> in Java): This has the best worst-case behaviour of any of the algorithms discussed, so will efficiently deal with any usage pattern or values you throw at it. This bitwise-SWAR algorithm could parallelize to be done in multiple vector elements at once, instead of in a single integer register, for a speedup on CPUs with SIMD but no usable popcount instruction. (e.g. x86-64 code that has to run on any CPU, not just Nehalem or later.) However, the best way to use vector instructions for popcount is usually by using a variable-shuffle to do a table-lookup for 4 bits at a time of each byte in parallel. (The 4 bits index a 16 entry table held in a vector register). On Intel CPUs, the hardware 64bit popcnt instruction can outperform an SSSE3 <code>PSHUFB</code> bit-parallel implementation by about a factor of 2, but only if your compiler gets it just right. Otherwise SSE can come out significantly ahead. Newer compiler versions are aware of the popcnt false dependency problem on Intel.

This is  impractical and it would be easier if  only one of the parameters should be  adjusted. To cope with this problem a  bias neuron is invented. The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. Consider the AND boolean function represented by the following neural network: ANN http://www.aihorizon.com/images/essays/perceptron.gif <li><em>w0</em> corresponds to <em>b</em>. <li><em>w1</em> corresponds to <em>x1</em>. <li><em>w2</em> corresponds to <em>x2</em>. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. For example, if we assume boolean values  of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one  way to use a two-input perceptron to  implement the AND function is to set  the weights w0 = -3, and w1 = w2 = .5. This perceptron can be made to  represent the OR function instead by  altering the threshold to w0 = -.3. In  fact, AND and OR can be viewed as  special cases of m-of-n functions:  that is, functions where at least m of  the n inputs to the perceptron must be  true. The OR function corresponds to  m = 1 and the AND function to m = n.  Any m-of-n function is easily  represented using a perceptron by  setting all input weights to the same  value (e.g., 0.5) and then setting the  threshold w0 accordingly. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR).

Apple's mobile version of WebKit, used in iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads, will scale the page to fit the screen, at which point the user can zoom in and out freely. That said, you can design your page to minimize the amount of zooming necessary. Your best bet is to make the width and height the same as the lower resolution of the iPad, since you don't know which way it's oriented; in other words, you would make your page 768x768, so that it will fit well on the iPad's screen whether it's oriented to be 1024x768 or 768x1024. More importantly, you'd want to design your page with big controls with lots of space that are easy to hit with your thumbs - you could easily design a 768x768 page that was very cluttered and therefore required lots of zooming. To accomplish this, you'll likely want to divide your controls among a number of web pages. On the other hand, it's not the most worthwhile pursuit. If while designing you find opportunities to make your page more \"finger-friendly\", then go for it...but the reality is that iPad users are very comfortable with moving around and zooming in and out of the page to get to things because it's necessary on most web sites. If anything, you probably want to design it so that it's conducive to this type of navigation. Make boxes with relevant grouped data that can be easily double-tapped to focus on, and keep related controls close to each other. iPad users will most likely appreciate a page that facilitates the familiar zoom-and-pan navigation they're accustomed to more than they will a page that has fewer controls so that they don't have to.", "truth": "[2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10]", "answer_id": 3375794}

Here is the very simple and straightforward way I'm doing it now: <code>public final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n){  if (n &lt; 0)    return false;  long tst = (long)(Math.sqrt(n) + 0.5);  return tst*tst == n;}</code> Notes: I'm using this function in many Project Euler problems. So no one else will ever have to maintain this code. And this kind of micro-optimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems. A new solution posted by A. Rex has proven to be even faster. In a run over the first 1 billion integers, the solution only required 34% of the time that the original solution used. While the John Carmack hack is a little better for small values of <em>n</em>, the benefit compared to this solution is pretty small. Here is the A. Rex solution, converted to Java: <code>private final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n){  // Quickfail  if( n &lt; 0 || ((n&amp;2) != 0) || ((n &amp; 7) == 5) || ((n &amp; 11) == 8) )    return

to the result of Math.sqrt() is not necessary, at least not on my machine. <li>The John Carmack hack was faster, but it gave incorrect results starting at n=410881. However, as suggested by BobbyShaftoe, we can use the Carmack hack for n &lt; 410881. <li>Newton's method was a good bit slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>. This is probably because <code>Math.sqrt()</code> uses something similar to Newton's Method, but implemented in the hardware so it's much faster than in Java. Also, Newton's Method still required use of doubles. <li>A modified Newton's method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow (I want this function to work with all positive 64-bit signed integers), and it was still slower than <code>Math.sqrt()</code>. <li>Binary chop was even slower. This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64-bit number. The one suggestion which did show improvements was made by John D. Cook. You can observe that the last hex digit (i.e. the last 4 bits) of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9. This means that 75% of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares. Implementing this solution resulted in about a 50% reduction in runtime. Working from John's suggestion, I investigated properties of the last <em>n</em> bits of a perfect square. By analyzing the last 6 bits, I found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits. This means 81% of values can be eliminated without using any math. Implementing this solution gave an additional 8% reduction in runtime (compared to my original algorithm). Analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical. Here is the code that I have used, which runs in 42% of the time required by the original algorithm (based on a run over the first 100 million integers). For values of <em>n</em> less than 410881, it runs in only 29% of the time required by the original algorithm. <code>private final static boolean isPerfectSquare(long n){  if (n &lt; 0)    return false;  switch((int)(n &amp; 0x3F))  {  case 0x00: case 0x01: case 0x04: case 0x09: case 0x10: case 0x11:  case 0x19: case 0x21: case 0x24: case 0x29: case 0x31: case 0x39:    long sqrt;    if(n &lt; 410881L)    {      //John Carmack hack, converted to Java. // See: http://www.codemaestro.com/reviews/9      int i;      float x2, y;      x2 = n * 0.5F;      y  = n;      i  = Float.floatToRawIntBits(y);      i  = 0x5f3759df - ( i &gt;&gt; 1 );      y  = Float.intBitsToFloat(i);      y  = y * ( 1.5F - ( x2 * y * y ) );      sqrt = (long)(1.0F/y);    }    else    {      //Carmack hack gives incorrect answer for n &gt;= 410881.      sqrt = (long)Math.sqrt(n);    }    return sqrt*sqrt == n;  default:    return false;  }}</code> <strong>Notes</strong>: <li>According to John's tests, using <code>or</code> statements is faster in C++ than using a <code>switch</code>, but in Java and C# there appears to be no difference between <code>or</code> and <code>switch</code>. <li>I also tried making a lookup table (as a private static array of 64 boolean values). Then instead of either switch or <code>or</code> statement, I would just say <code>if(lookup[(int)(n&amp;0x3F)]) { test } else return false;</code>. To my surprise, this was (just slightly) slower.

It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). As stated in the MDN, some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript. An example of  where this is used is web services responses. In the 'old' days, web services used XML as their primary data format for transmitting back data, but since JSON appeared (The JSON format is specified in RFC 4627 by Douglas Crockford), it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweight You can find a lot more info on the official JSON web site. JSON is built on two structures: A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. JSON Structure Here is an example of JSON data: JSON in JavaScript JSON (in Javascript) is a string! People often assume all Javascript objects are JSON and that JSON is a Javascript object. This is incorrect. In Javascript <code>var x = {x:y}</code> is not JSON, this is a Javascript object. The two are not the same thing. The JSON equivalent (represented in the Javascript language) would be <code>var x = '{\"x\":\"y\"}'</code>. <code>x</code> is an object of type string not an object in it's own right. To turn this into a fully fledged Javascript object you must first parse it, <code>var x = JSON.parse('{\"x\":\"y\"}');</code>, <code>x</code> is now an object but this is not JSON anymore. See Javascript object Vs JSON When working with JSON and JavaScript, you may be tempted to use the <code>eval</code> function to evaluate the result returned in the callback, but this is not suggested since there are two characters (U+2028 &amp; U+2029) valid in JSON but not in JavaScript (read more of this here). Therefore, one must always try to use Crockford's script that checks for a valid JSON before evaluating it. Link to the script explanation is found here and here is a direct link to the js file. Every major browser nowadays has its own implementation for this. Example on how to use the JSON parser (with the json from the above code snippet): The JSON parser also offers another very useful method, <code>stringify</code>. This method accepts a JavaScript object as a parameter, and outputs back a string with JSON format. This is useful for when you want to send data back to the server: The above two methods (<code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>) also take a second parameter, which is a function that will be called for every key and value at every level of the final result, and each value will be replaced by result of your inputted function.

When you invoke an EXE file like this with complex command line arguments it is usually very helpful to have a tool that will show you how PowerShell sends the arguments to the EXE file. The PowerShell Community Extensions has such a tool. It is called echoargs. You just replace the EXE file with echoargs - leaving all the arguments in place, and it will show you how the EXE file will receive the arguments, for example: Using echoargs you can experiment until you get it right, for example: It turns out I was trying too hard before to maintain the double quotes around the connection string.

HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and    password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're    doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by    default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password    only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on    the network between you and the remote server. To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers    returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even    --anyauth might be options that suit you. Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP    proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy    may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to    the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,    use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest. If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password    part, curl will prompt for the password interactively. Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see    when listing the running processes of the system. Thus, other users may be    able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line    options. There are ways to circumvent this.

For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way.

I think that for common practices, Git and Mercurial are more than sufficient. They both have big projects that use them (Git -> linux kernel, Mercurial -> Mozilla foundation projects, both among others of course), so I don't think either are really lacking something.

JSON is a data format. There's no call. The 2nd search result is from some guy named Remy, who writes this about JSONP: JSONP is script tag injection, passing the response from the server in to a user specified function. I can sort of understand that, but it's still not making any sense. So what is JSONP? Why was it created (what problem does it solve)? And why would I use it?

This trick makes it possible for the server to \"inject\" javascript code directly in the Client browser and this with bypassing the \"same origin\" restrictions. In other words, you can have cross-domain data exchange. Normally, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> doesn't permit cross-domain data-exchange directly (one needs to go through a server in the same domain) whereas: <code>&lt;script src=\"some_other_domain/some_data.js&amp;prefix=function_prefix</code>>` one can access data from a domain different than from the origin. Also worth noting: even though the server should be considered as \"trusted\" before attempting that sort of \"trick\", the side-effects of possible change in object format etc. can be contained.

A class can implement multiple Interfaces. <strong>Abstract Class:</strong> Only Abstract methods have to be implemented by the subclass. An Abstract class can have normal methods with implementations. Abstract class can also have class variables beside Events, Delegates, Properties and Methods.

However, reading of a class variables is ok inside of the function, but writing inside of this function will generate a compiler error. Another way of thinking about such \"const function\" is by viewing an class function as a normal function taking an implicit <code>this</code> pointer. So a method <code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg)</code> (without the const at the end) results in a function like <code>int Foo_Bar(Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>, and a call such as <code>Foo f; f.Bar(4)</code> will internally correspond to something like <code>Foo f; Foo_Bar(&amp;f, 4)</code>. Now adding the const at the end (<code>int Foo::Bar(int random_arg) const</code>) can then be understood as a declaration with a const this pointer: <code>int Foo_Bar(const Foo* this, int random_arg)</code>. Since the type of <code>this</code> in such case is const, no modifications of member variables are possible. It is possible to loosen the \"const function\" restriction of not allowing the function to write to any variable of a class. To allow some of the variables to be writable even when the function is marked as a \"const function\", these class variables are marked with the keyword <code>mutable</code>. Thus, if a class variable is marked as mutable, and a \"const function\" writes to this variable then the code will compile cleanly and the variable is possible to change. (C++11) As usual when dealing with the <code>const</code> keyword, changing the location of the const key word in a C++ statement has entirely different meanings. The above usage of <code>const</code> only apply when adding <code>const</code> to the end of the function declaration after the parenthesis. <code>const</code> is a highly overused qualifier in C++ and the syntax and ordering is often not straightforward in combination with pointers.

Here it is:", "tags": ["jsf", "jsf-2", "logout", "viewexpiredexception"], "answer_posts": [3642969], "answer_body": "Introduction The <code>ViewExpiredException</code> will be thrown whenever the <code>javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD</code> is set to <code>server</code> (default) and the enduser sends a HTTP POST request on a view via <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h:commandLink&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h:commandButton&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code>, while the associated view state isn't available in the session anymore. The view state is identified as value of a hidden input field <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> of the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code>. With the state saving method set to <code>server</code>, this contains only the view state ID which references a serialized view state in the session. So, when the session is expired for some reason (either timed out in server or client side, or the session cookie is not maintained anymore for some reason in browser, or by calling <code>HttpSession#invalidate()</code> in server, or due a server specific bug with session cookies as known in WildFly), then the serialized view state is not available anymore in the session and the enduser will get this exception. To understand the working of the session, see also How do servlets work? Instantiation, sessions, shared variables and multithreading. There is also a limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session. When the limit is hit, then the least recently used view will be expired. See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. With the state saving method set to <code>client</code>, the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden input field contains instead the whole serialized view state, so the enduser won't get a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when the session expires. It can however still happen on a cluster environment (\"ERROR: MAC did not verify\" is symptomatic) and/or when there's a implementation-specific timeout on the client side state configured and/or when server re-generates the AES key during restart, see also Getting ViewExpiredException in clustered environment while state saving method is set to client and user session is valid how to solve it. Regardless of the solution, make sure you do not use <code>enableRestoreView11Compatibility</code>. it does not at all restore the original view state. It basically recreates the view and all associated view scoped beans from scratch and hereby thus losing all of original data (state). As the application will behave in a confusing way (\"Hey, where are my input values..?? \"), this is very bad for user experience. Better use stateless views or <code>&lt;o:enableRestorableView&gt;</code> instead so you can manage it on a specific view only instead of on all views. As to the why JSF needs to save view state, head to this answer: Why JSF saves the state of UI components on server? Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page navigation In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when e.g. navigating back after logout when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, only redirecting the POST request after logout is not sufficient. You also need to instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, otherwise the browser may show them from the cache instead of requesting a fresh one from the server when you send a GET request on it (e.g. by back button). The <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field of the cached page may contain a view state ID value which is not valid anymore in the current session. If you're (ab)using POST (command links/buttons) instead of GET (regular links/buttons) for page-to-page navigation, and click such a command link/button on the cached page, then this will in turn fail with a <code>ViewExpiredException</code>. To fire a redirect after logout in JSF 2.0, either add <code>&lt;redirect /&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;navigation-case&gt;</code> in question (if any), or add <code>?faces-redirect=true</code> to the <code>outcome</code> value. or To instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, create a <code>Filter</code> which is mapped on the servlet name of the <code>FacesServlet</code> and adds the needed response headers to disable the browser cache. E.g. Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page refresh In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when refreshing the current page when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, you not only need to make sure you are performing page-to-page navigation exclusively by GET (regular links/buttons), but you also need to make sure that you are exclusively using ajax to submit the forms. If you're submitting the form synchronously (non-ajax) anyway, then you'd best either make the view stateless (see later section), or to send a redirect after POST (see previous section). Having a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> on page refresh is in default configuration a very rare case. It can only happen when the limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session is hit. So, it will only happen when you've manually set that limit way too low, or that you're continuously creating new views in background (e.g. by a badly implemented poll). See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. Another cause is having duplicate JSF libraries in runtime classpath conflicting each other. The correct procedure to install JSF is outlined in our JSF wiki page. Handling ViewExpiredException When you want to handle an unavoidable <code>ViewExpiredException</code> after a POST action on an arbitrary page which was already opened in some browser tab/window while you're logged out in another tab/window, then you'd like to specify an <code>error-page</code> for that in <code>web.xml</code> which goes to a \"Your session is timed out\" page. E.g. Use if necessary a meta refresh header in the error page in case you intend to actually redirect further to home or login page. (the <code>0</code> in <code>content</code> represents the amount of seconds before redirect, <code>0</code> thus means \"redirect immediately\", you can use e.g. <code>3</code> to let the browser wait 3 seconds with the redirect) Note that handling exceptions during ajax requests requires a special <code>ExceptionHandler</code>. See also Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request. You can find a live example at OmniFaces <code>FullAjaxExceptionHandler</code> showcase page (this also covers non-ajax requests). Also note that your \"general\" error page should be mapped on <code>&lt;error-code&gt;</code> of <code>500</code> instead of an <code>&lt;exception-type&gt;</code> of e.g. <code>java.lang.Exception</code> or <code>java.lang.Throwable</code>, otherwise all exceptions wrapped in <code>ServletException</code> such as <code>ViewExpiredException</code> would still end up in the general error page. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml. Stateless views A completely different alternative is to run JSF views in stateless mode. This way nothing of JSF state will be saved and the views will never expire, but just be rebuilt from scratch on every request. You can turn on stateless views by setting the <code>transient</code> attribute of <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>: This way the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field will get a fixed value of <code>\"stateless\"</code> in Mojarra (have not checked MyFaces at this point). Note that this feature was introduced in Mojarra 2.1.19 and 2.2.0 and is not available in older versions. The consequence is that you cannot use view scoped beans anymore. They will now behave like request scoped beans. One of the disadvantages is that you have to track the state yourself by fiddling with hidden inputs and/or loose request parameters. Mainly those forms with input fields with <code>rendered</code>, <code>readonly</code> or <code>disabled</code> attributes which are controlled by ajax events will be affected. Note that the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> does not necessarily need to be unique throughout the view and/or reside in the master template only. It's also completely legit to redeclare and nest it in a template client. It basically \"extends\" the parent <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> then. E.g. in master template: and in template client: You can even wrap the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;c:if&gt;</code> to make it conditional. Note that it would apply on the entire view, not only on the nested contents, such as the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> in above example. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml Check if session exists JSF Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request Unrelated to the concrete problem, using HTTP POST for pure page-to-page navigation isn't very user/SEO friendly. In JSF 2.0 you should really prefer <code>&lt;h:link&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h:button&gt;</code> over the <code>&lt;h:commandXxx&gt;</code> ones for plain vanilla page-to-page navigation.

As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>\"multipart/form-data\"</code>. After submitting such a form, the binary multipart form data is available in the request body in a different format than when the <code>enctype</code> isn't set. Before Servlet 3.0, the Servlet API didn't natively support <code>multipart/form-data</code>. It supports only the default form enctype of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.

Don't manually parse it! You can in theory parse the request body yourself based on <code>ServletRequest#getInputStream()</code>. However, this is a precise and tedious work which requires precise knowledge of RFC2388.

See also uploading of pdf file. You should rather use a real library which is used (and implicitly tested!) by millions of users for years. Such a library has proven its robustness. When you're already on Servlet 3.0 or newer, use native API If you're using at least Servlet 3.0 (Tomcat 7, Jetty 9, JBoss AS 6, GlassFish 3, etc), then you can just use standard API provided <code>HttpServletRequest#getPart()</code> to collect the individual multipart form data items (most Servlet 3.0 implementations actually use Apache Commons FileUpload under the covers for this!). Also, normal form fields are available by <code>getParameter()</code> the usual way. First annotate your servlet with <code>@MultipartConfig</code> in order to let it recognize and support <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests and thus get <code>getPart()</code> to work: Then, implement its <code>doPost()</code> as follows: Note the <code>Path#getFileName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. In case you have a <code>&lt;input type=\"file\" name=\"file\" multiple=\"true\" /&gt;</code> for multi-file upload, collect them as below (unfortunately there is no such method as <code>request.getParts(\"file\")</code>): When you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, manually get submitted file name Note that <code>Part#getSubmittedFileName()</code> was introduced in Servlet 3.1 (Tomcat 8, Jetty 9, WildFly 8, GlassFish 4, etc). If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name. Note the MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. When you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet, use Apache Commons FileUpload If you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet (isn't it about time to upgrade? ), the common practice is to make use of Apache Commons FileUpload to parse the multpart form data requests. It has an excellent User Guide and FAQ (carefully go through both). There's also the O'Reilly (\"cos\") <code>MultipartRequest</code>, but it has some (minor) bugs and isn't actively maintained anymore for years. I wouldn't recommend using it. Apache Commons FileUpload is still actively maintained and currently very mature. In order to use Apache Commons FileUpload, you need to have at least the following files in your webapp's <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>: <code>commons-fileupload.jar</code> <code>commons-io.jar</code> Your initial attempt failed most likely because you forgot the commons IO. Here's a kickoff example how the <code>doPost()</code> of your <code>UploadServlet</code> may look like when using Apache Commons FileUpload: It's very important that you don't call <code>getParameter()</code>, <code>getParameterMap()</code>, <code>getParameterValues()</code>, <code>getInputStream()</code>, <code>getReader()</code>, etc on the same request beforehand. Otherwise the servlet container will read and parse the request body and thus Apache Commons FileUpload will get an empty request body. See also a.o. ServletFileUpload#parseRequest(request) returns an empty list. Note the <code>FilenameUtils#getName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. Alternatively you can also wrap this all in a <code>Filter</code> which parses it all automagically and put the stuff back in the parametermap of the request so that you can continue using <code>request.getParameter()</code> the usual way and retrieve the uploaded file by <code>request.getAttribute()</code>. You can find an example in this blog article. Workaround for GlassFish3 bug of <code>getParameter()</code> still returning <code>null</code> Note that Glassfish versions older than 3.1.2 had a bug wherein the <code>getParameter()</code> still returns <code>null</code>. If you are targeting such a container and can't upgrade it, then you need to extract the value from <code>getPart()</code> with help of this utility method: Saving uploaded file (don't use <code>getRealPath()</code> nor <code>part.write()</code>!)

According to Wikipedia: GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> as well as the other HTTP methods, if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method, the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why <code>GET</code> should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request. So if you, for example, poll using the same <code>GET</code> request you will always get back the same results, even if the data you are querying is being updated server-side. One way to alleviate this problem is to make the URL unique for each request by appending a timestamp.", "truth": "[2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15]", "answer_id": 3477374}

Example: In this example, you know that you passed a <code>MyClass</code> object, and thus there isn't any need for a runtime check to ensure this. dynamic_cast <code>dynamic_cast</code> is useful when you don't know what the dynamic type of the object is. It returns a null pointer if the object referred to doesn't contain the type casted to as a base class (when you cast to a reference, a <code>bad_cast</code> exception is thrown in that case). You cannot use <code>dynamic_cast</code> if you downcast (cast to a derived class) and the argument type is not polymorphic. For example, the following code is not valid, because <code>Base</code> doesn't contain any virtual function: An \"up-cast\" (cast to the base class) is always valid with both <code>static_cast</code> and <code>dynamic_cast</code>, and also without any cast, as an \"up-cast\" is an implicit conversion. Regular Cast These casts are also called C-style cast. A C-style cast is basically identical to trying out a range of sequences of C++ casts, and taking the first C++ cast that works, without ever considering <code>dynamic_cast</code>. Needless to say, this is much more powerful as it combines all of <code>const_cast</code>, <code>static_cast</code> and <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, but it's also unsafe, because it does not use <code>dynamic_cast</code>. In addition, C-style casts not only allow you to do this, but they also allow you to safely cast to a private base-class, while the \"equivalent\" <code>static_cast</code> sequence would give you a compile-time error for that.
